1. Open up Internet Explorer and sign into your Instagram Account
2. Open the hashtags.txt file in this folder and add hashtags,
   without the (#) hash symbol and put each hashtag on a new line. 
   The example hashtags are laid out exactly how you need to put them in there
   so follow that and you won't fuck up the script.
3. Download AutoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com/download/). Use the installer
   or use your preferred method for download. I don't care, just as long as you
   download it. You need this to run the script.
4. After AutoHotKey is downloaded, double click on the instaScript.ahk file. 

If you need to Exit the script for any reason, click on the desktop and hit the ESC key.
You can run the script and do other things on your computer if you'd like. You can even
minimize the window. It will still work in the background.

If you encounter any errors, make sure you followed this instruction list to
the letter. The majority of problems you will encounter will be from not 
following the instructions.

If the script crashes, take a screenshot of the error message and log an issue in the Issues section
of the GitHub repo. I will take a look and see if it is something I need to fix. 

You can restart the script and it should run fine. Most errors that occur during the running of the
script are due to the webpage bonking out in an unexpected way. 

FAQ - 

Q: Can I use Chrome, Firefox or some other browser?
A: Not at this moment, but plans are to make it so you can. 

Q: Will this get my account shut down? 
A: I've done everything in my power to make this as erratic as possible, but there is a chance
   that it could. I've been running it on a dummy account of mine for a while though and haven't
   had any problems.

Q: Can I choose what photos to like?
A: This is automated, so it randomly likes photos based on no criteria other than a hashtag. 

Q: Can it comment on the photos? 
A: Not yet, but that is coming soon.

Q: Can it tag other people in comments?
A: On the features list, but not yet implemented.

Q: Do I need to install AutoHotKey for this to work?
A: I mean, you can try it without it, but AutoHotKey is the scripting language that allows
   this beautiful beast to run, so if you can get it to work without it, let me know and I'll
   revamp the instructions.

Q: How many hashtags can I use?
A: You can use as many hashtags as your heart desires. It will just keep looping through them forever.
   It's best to use 30 or more hashtags so that way by the time it loops back around, there is fresh
   content for the script to work with. I like to use a hashtag generator like All Hashtag 
   (https://www.all-hashtag.com) to generate my list. Just make sure when you copy and paste, 
   you remove the hash symbols and put each hashtag on it's own line.
